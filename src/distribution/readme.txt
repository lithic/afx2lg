This package contains three AxeFx II utilities for Windows and Mac.
For more details on all of these please visit:

  https://afx2lg.googlecode.com/

axebackup:  Backup all of your AxeFx II data.

axeloader: Send presets, backups, IR files and firmware to the AxeFx II.
           This utility has special support for the "Axe Change"
           (http://axechange.fractalaudio.com/) in that it makes sure that a
           preset downloaded from that web site, will not overwrite an existing
           preset on your AxeFx.

afx2lg:    A utility to update and generate setup files for the Little Giant
           from Gordius (http://gordius.be).

example_setup.lgp: This is an example setup file for the Gordius Little Giant
           More information is to be had on the above wiki page.
